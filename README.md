# For contributors

Thank you for improving the code! There are things you need to remember to collaborate with others.

- When creating a pull request to resolve an issue, please leave comment in the issue to avoid working on the same issue as someone else.
- Keep your PR as small as possible. This means limit your PR to one type (docs, feature, refactoring, ci, or bugfix)
